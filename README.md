# Pokemon Combat (Python OOP Challenge)
![ash](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2930092.jpg)

Object oriented programming paradigm (OOP) allows to create whatever custom data types we can think of. In this case, and aiming to practice concepts we just have learned, we create a data type (class) called pokemon. This class contains the basic characteristics a Pokemon can have, like name, type (water, fire, bug, earth or wind), heigth and weigth. Additionally, each Pokemon have an attack random level power which will allow it to combat against another pokemon.

# Pokemons
* Skrelp
* Masquerain

# Code
The code consist of a simple structure where we instantiate each pokemon with given attributes plus a random power of attack and a life spam called hit points.

Additionally we created a combat method at which pokemon can combat against each other and result in one of them fainting and the other as the winner.
